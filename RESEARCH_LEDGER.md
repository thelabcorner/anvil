# ANVIL Research Ledger — Initial Implementation

## Experiment A — Greedy LZ + adaptive arithmetic backend

**Hypothesis:** Separate adaptive models for token type, literal-run length, match length, distance, and literals can give a compact first implementation without transmitting entropy tables.

**Result:** Correct and compact, but the Fenwick-backed arithmetic decoder is the dominant performance problem.

On the 26,904-byte Project ANVIL task document:

- encoded size: 11,212 bytes
- ratio: 0.417
- encode: 18.76 MB/s
- decode: 21.19 MB/s

**Conclusion:** Keep as a ratio/reference backend, not the primary performance path.

## Experiment B — Bit-cost-aware DP parse

**Hypothesis:** A parse minimizing an estimated bit objective can beat longest-match greedy parsing.

**Result:** With the same order-0 arithmetic backend, output fell from 11,212 to 11,107 bytes (-0.94%), while encode throughput fell from 18.76 to 4.41 MB/s.

**Conclusion:** The representation responds to parse optimization. The next parser iteration should use costs derived from the actual downstream coder and reduce candidate-search overhead.

## Experiment C — Naive order-1 literal contexts

**Hypothesis:** Previous-byte contexts improve literal entropy.

**Result:** On the task document, order-1 increased DP output from 11,107 to 11,491 bytes (+3.46%). The sparse per-context models spend too long in cold-start states.

**Conclusion:** Reject unconditional order-1 as a default. Confidence-gated modes remain implemented for cross-corpus testing, but the current document selects order-0.

## Experiment D — Separated-stream static rANS

**Hypothesis:** De-interleaving token domains and replacing Fenwick arithmetic decoding with static rANS will materially improve decode speed at modest ratio cost.

**Result:** DP+rANS produces 11,232 bytes versus 11,107 for DP+arithmetic (+1.13%), but median decode throughput improved from ~20.16 MB/s to ~163.72 MB/s (~8.1x). Greedy+rANS reaches ~145.44 MB/s decode and ~39.49 MB/s encode on the same document.

**Conclusion:** Strongly validated. rANS becomes the performance backend; arithmetic remains a compression-ratio comparator.

| Codec | Bytes | Ratio | Encode MB/s | Decode MB/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ANVIL greedy arithmetic | 11,212 | 0.417 | 18.76 | 21.19 |
| ANVIL DP arithmetic | 11,107 | 0.413 | 4.41 | 20.16 |
| ANVIL greedy rANS | 11,414 | 0.424 | 39.49 | 145.44 |
| ANVIL DP rANS | 11,232 | 0.417 | 4.95 | 163.72 |
| Brotli q1 | 11,903 | 0.442 | 248.05 | 321.72 |
| Brotli q4 | 10,203 | 0.379 | 65.47 | 537.29 |
| Brotli q6 | 9,725 | 0.361 | 44.58 | 547.45 |
| Brotli q9 | 9,709 | 0.361 | 4.14 | 467.94 |
| Brotli q11 | 8,275 | 0.308 | 1.01 | 359.05 |
| Zstd 1 | 11,103 | 0.413 | 364.01 | 913.42 |
| Zstd 3 | 10,594 | 0.394 | 283.02 | 826.57 |
| Zstd 9 | 10,115 | 0.376 | 59.96 | 761.44 |
| Zstd 19 | 9,880 | 0.367 | 5.96 | 711.82 |

This is one small development file, not evidence of a general-purpose win. ANVIL currently beats Brotli q1 in compressed bytes on this input, but loses badly in throughput, so it is **not** a Pareto victory.

## Next highest-value experiments

1. Replace sampled heuristic DP costs with measured rANS stream costs and iterative re-parsing.
2. Replace byte-at-a-time match-copy with specialized small-distance and wide-copy kernels.
3. Add four-way interleaved rANS states to expose instruction-level parallelism.
4. Encode distance as class + low bits instead of generic varint bytes.
5. Introduce a dual-timescale phrase dictionary across independent blocks.
6. Test lightweight reversible transforms only through the block router; reject them unless end-to-end bytes improve.
7. Add standard corpora and peak-RSS measurement before making any cross-codec performance claims.

## Four-file smoke aggregate

A second smoke pass used four heterogeneous local files: the ANVIL task markdown, the ANVIL C++ source, deterministic generated JSON, and 256 KiB deterministic pseudo-random data. This is still **not** a standard corpus and used one timed repetition per codec, so treat throughput as directional.

Environment:

- x86-64, AMD EPYC 9V74
- Debian GNU/Linux 13
- GCC 14.2.0, `-O3 -DNDEBUG`
- Brotli library 1.1.0
- Zstd 1.5.7

Aggregate result is computed as total compressed bytes / total input bytes. Aggregate throughput is total bytes divided by summed per-file measured time.

| Codec | Aggregate ratio | Encode MB/s | Decode MB/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ANVIL greedy arithmetic | 0.371942 | 19.59 | 50.37 |
| ANVIL DP arithmetic | 0.345498 | 2.88 | 61.04 |
| ANVIL greedy rANS | 0.372972 | 39.31 | 218.70 |
| ANVIL DP rANS | 0.345777 | 3.05 | 225.05 |
| Brotli q1 | 0.365250 | 484.83 | 786.50 |
| Brotli q4 | 0.364779 | 150.44 | 1039.58 |
| Brotli q6 | 0.347324 | 54.60 | 1142.93 |
| Brotli q9 | 0.342482 | 16.60 | 1085.65 |
| Brotli q11 | 0.311155 | 0.99 | 650.92 |
| Zstd 1 | 0.360045 | 758.19 | 1809.03 |
| Zstd 3 | 0.359825 | 592.25 | 2187.74 |
| Zstd 9 | 0.349152 | 87.03 | 1758.20 |
| Zstd 19 | 0.325202 | 3.29 | 1820.75 |

Interesting result: DP+rANS reaches ratio 0.345777, slightly smaller than Brotli q6's 0.347324 in this smoke aggregate, but it is far slower in both encode and decode throughput. Therefore this is **not a Pareto win**; it only demonstrates that the current representation has enough ratio potential to justify continued systems work.

The raw row-level data is in `tests/benchmark-suite.csv`.
